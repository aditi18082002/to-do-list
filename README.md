# To-do-list 
# Overview
The "Task List 2023" project is a simple web application designed to help users manage and organize their tasks. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and deleting tasks.

# Project Structure

# HTML Structure
The project's HTML structure is organized as follows:

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Specifies the HTML document type and version.
2. `<html lang="en">`: Defines the root HTML element with English as the language.
3. `<head>`: Contains metadata and external resource references.
   - Metadata: Specifies character encoding and compatibility settings.
   - `<title>`: Sets the page title to "Task List 2023."
   - `<link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css" />`: Links an external CSS file for styling.

4. `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the web page.

   - `<header>`: The header section displays the page title and a form for adding tasks.
     - `<h1>`: Main title displaying "Task List 2023."
     - `<form id="new-task-form">`: Form for adding new tasks.
       - `<input type="text" name="new-task-input" id="new-task-input" placeholder="What do you have planned?" />`: Input field for task descriptions.
       - `<input type="submit" id="new-task-submit" value="Add task" />`: Submit button to add tasks.
- `<main>`: This section contains the primary content of the web page.

     - `<section class="task-list">`: A section for displaying the list of tasks.
       - `<h2>`: Subheading displaying "Tasks."

       - `<div id="tasks">`: An empty `<div>` element intended to hold individual task items.
         - Note: The task items themselves are commented out and are likely added dynamically using JavaScript.

5. `<script src="main.js"></script>`: Includes an external JavaScript file for scripting and interactivity.

# CSS Styling
The project utilizes an external CSS file named "main.css" to style the web page. Details of the CSS styling are not provided in the code snippet, but this file would contain rules for visual presentation, layout, and responsiveness.

# JavaScript Logic
The project relies on an external JavaScript file named "main.js" for its functionality. The JavaScript logic, not shown in the code snippet, is responsible for tasks such as:
   - Adding new tasks to the task list.
   - Editing existing tasks.
   - Deleting tasks.
   - Updating the task list dynamically in response to user interactions.

# Usage
Users can interact with the web application by:
- Entering a task description in the input field.
- Clicking the "Add task" button to add a new task.
- Optionally editing or deleting existing tasks (functionality likely implemented in JavaScript).

# Next Steps
To fully implement this project, the following tasks need to be completed:
- Develop the JavaScript logic to handle task addition, editing, and deletion.
- Implement CSS styling for the visual presentation of the web page.
- Test the web application to ensure it functions as intended.
- Deploy the project to a web server or hosting platform for public access.
